# Lehigh-Valley-Hackathon

Our project is a website that allows students to access textbooks at a much more affordable cost. Although Lehigh has the Learning Unlimited system for $375, some students find this unaffordable and unreasonable. Furthermore, some classes don't require textbooks, so this cost would simply be unnecessary. 

The website prompts users to log in with their Lehigh.edu email, making the website only accessible to Lehigh students. Users are brought to the page "Lehigh University Textbook Network". This page allows users to input the textbook they are looking for. There is also a profile page with user information and a "List a textbook" page to upload a textbook. Users who are uploading can import their textbook file, the class the textbook is used for, and any other additional information they think may be helpful. We use a database to store all of these inputs. 

To create this website, we utilized Flask to create a Python-based website. We also used the SQL Alchemy library to have a SQL database for the storage of textbook information. SQL Alchemy is an object-relational mapper that essentially translates a Python statement into a SQL query.

To operate this, create a Python virtual environment, install Flask and SQL Alchemy, and run app.py.
